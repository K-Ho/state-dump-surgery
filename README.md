## State Dump Surgeon

Takes a state dump generated by the contracts-v2 repo and a dump from a currently live Geth2. The `deployment.json` has info on which Synthetix contracts are deployed to which addresses, and the `compiled` folder contains the Synthetix contracts compiled with latest `@eth-optimism/solc`. This script will Take the v2 dump, add in ProxyEOA bytecode at each EOA address found in the Geth2 dump. It will also find all of the Synthetix contracts (using the `deployment.json`) and replace their bytecode with the `compiled` folder to be compatible with contracts-v2.
